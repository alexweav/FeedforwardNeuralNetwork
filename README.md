# FeedforwardNeuralNetwork
A class for constructing and evaluating feedforward neural networks

Provides simple tools for building, evaluating, and training a feedforward, fully connected neural network.

##About Neural Networks

An artificial neural network is a machine learning model based on actual neurons.  The behavior of a neuron is straightforward: It takes a number of numerical inputs, multiplies each input by a respective weight, and outputs some numerical value related to the inputs.

The neurons used in this model are known as *Sigmoid Neurons*.  Sigmoid neurons do the following:

1.  Take a vector of numerical inputs.
2.  Multiply each numerical input by some weight.  The weights for two different inputs may be different values.
3.  Take the summation of the weighted input values. This can also be represented by a dot product between an input vector and a weight vector.
4.  Add some value to the summation, known as the *bias* or the *threshold*.
4.  Pass the resulting value through the *Sigmoid* function.
